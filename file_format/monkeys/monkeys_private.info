past_usage = 'Many methods have been tried on the MNIST database, in its original data split (60,000 training examples, 10,000 test examples, 10 classes). See http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. This dataset was used in the NIPS 2003 Feature Selection Challenge under the name GISETTE and in the WCCI 2006 Performance Prediction Challenge and the IJCNN 2007 Agnostic Learning vs. Prior Knowledge Challenge under the name GINA, and in the ICML 2011 Unsupervised and Transfer Learning Challenge under the name ULE.'
description = 'This is a dataset of handwritten digits. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits in pixel representation have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image by the authors. The data are quantized on 256 gray level values.'
preparation = 'For the purpose of the AutoML challenge, all samples were merged and the data were freshly randomly split in three sets: training, validation, and test. The order of the features (pixels) was also randomize, after adding a few distractor features (probes) that are permuted versions of real features.'
